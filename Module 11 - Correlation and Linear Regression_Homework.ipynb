If we were to ask 100 people their specific height - we would not receive 100 identical answers; instead, we would likely receive different values (with some overlap). This variation in values is variance. When variance is observed, the next step is to determine what the factors are between the variance - in other words, what factors are responsible for the difference in height between the 100 people? Gender is likely an important consideration - as males tend to be taller on average. But is that the only reason some people are taller or shorter than others? Maybe ethnicity is influencing this variance - some ethnic groups are naturally taller than others. Genetics might also contribute; as taller parents typically have taller children.\n",

In this example, these factors are independent variables and the height of the individual is the dependent variable.

    "## Things to Consider when using Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we get a sense of the relationship between our variables, we need to make some decisions on which variables to include in our regression analyses. <b>We only want to include the variables that have some kind of relationship with your dependent variable(s) of interest.</b> This allows us to cut back on the empty \"noise\" in your dataset and focus on the variables that are meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Redundancy\n",
    "Be careful with including multiple variables that show similar information. For example, if you have a variable \"Hours of Study\" which represents the total hours that a student studied, and you've also binned that data and created a new variable \"Study Level\" which groups students into \"high, med, low\" - you now have two variables in your dataset that show similar information, although one variable is a lot more specific. When you have this situation, you should elect to keep the variable that has the more detailed information (i.e. the specific hours of study). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Groups\n",
    "Variables with a lot of different levels (i.e. State of Residence) don't do well in regression models. If you have a variable that has a large number of different groups, unless this variable is vital to your analyses, you should work to reduce the number of overall groups (i.e State can become Region), or leave the variable out of the analyses. It is possible to include these complicated variables, but it isn't always the easiest interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confounding Variables\n",
    "When we preform regression analyses, we are interested in further understanding the relationship between the dependent and independent variable. Simply put, we are interested in investigating how the independent variable effects the dependent variable. However, it's rarely this simple and there are other factors that need to be understood and controlled. A confounding variable is a third variable that influences both the independent and dependent variable to some degree. It is important to acknowledge this third variable to ensure that the results of your analyses are valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you collect data on sunburns and ice cream consumption. You find that higher ice cream consumption is associated with a higher rate of sunburns. Does this mean that eating ice cream causes sunburns? Absolutely not, there are several other factors that can be attributed to this trend -- but most likely, the confounding variable is temperature. Hot temperatures cause people to eat more ice cream and result in people spending more time outdoors, which can result in more sunburns. Without accounting for the confounding variable(s), you may find relationships between variables that might not actually exist. To control for the potential effects of confounding variables, you simply have to include them in your regression model as another independent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you include all of your assumed confounding variables in your regression model, you are controlling for the effects of all of them, and if you find there is still a relationship between a specific independent variable and your dependent variable, you will know that relationship isn't being influenced by any of these other factors."

    "\n",
    "But what does that mean non-graphically? Linear regression may not always be the right technique to use for the specific set of data. The fit of the model describes how well your variables explain the variance in the dependent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the model fit, we look at the adjusted R-squared (Adj. R-squared). The Adj. R-squared is a statistical measure of how closely the data are to the fitted regression line. <B>The Adj. R-squared is the percentage of variation in the dependent variable that can be explained by all the independent variables included in the model.</B> For example, how much of the variation in student grades (i.e. grades ranging from 32-100) can be explained by hours of study, age, hours of exercise, gender, etc? Values range from 0 to 1; the higher the value, the better the fit. \n",

    "### Intercept\n",
    "***\n",
    "The y-intercept, or constant, is the value given to the dependent variable if all independent variables are equal to 0. For example, when all independent variables are equal to 0, the expected student grade is approximately 58. Don't worry too much about this interpretation, oftentimes this won't make sense - for example, if age equals 0, but it's important to know how to review this. \n",

    "These values show how changes in the independent variable influence the dependent variable, and in what direction. \n",

    "#### <b> Interpreting Numeric Variable Coefficients </b>\n",
    "When you are looking at numeric variables (i.e. age), each coefficient represents the numeric change in the dependent variable given a one-unit change in the independent variable. For example, for every one hour increase in study time (hours), grade increases by 1.9 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>INTERCEPT</b>: when all other IV's are zero, expected grade is around 58\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>AGE</b>: for every one year increase in age, grade increases by 0.04 points (when controlling for hours of study, exercise, and gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>EXERCISE</b>: for every one hour increase in exercise, grade increases by approximately 1 point (when controlling for age, hours of study, and gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>HOURS</b>: for every one hour increase in study time, grade increases by 1.9 points (when controlling for age, hours of exercise, and gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a variable that gives you a negative coefficient, the relationship moves in opposite directions. For example, say the coefficient for age was <b>- 0.0405</b>, you would interpret it in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>AGE</b>: for every one year increase in age, grade <u>decreases</u> by 0.04 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <b> Interpreting Categorical Variable Coefficients </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with categorical variables, the model will automatically take one of the categories and use it as a reference (i.e. comparison category). This reference category will not show up in the listed coefficients, and that is how you will be able to identify which category is serving as the reference. In our model, gender is the only categorical variable, and can be interpreted: \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>GENDER</b>:\n",
    "* Female is the reference category\n",
    "* On average, Male students have a grade 0.44 points lower than Female students (when controlling for age, hours of study, and exercise) \n",
    "\n",
    "The grade is lower because the coefficient is negative in this model. If we have more than 2 categories for our categorical variable, we would still compare each level to the reference. For example, if we had a group of students who choose not to disclose their gender, the coefficient for the 'undisclosed' group would show up in our model with it's own coefficient and we would compare those results to the Female category. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard Error (std err)\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error reflects the level of accuracy of the coefficients. The lower the value, the higher the level of accuracy.\n",

    "### Statistical Significance \n",
    "***\n",
    "#### p-value (P>|t|)\n",
    "When trying to determine if the results we received are statistically important - we need to consider the p-value. The p-value is the probability that you will receive the same results solely by chance (aka there is no meaning behind the results). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the p-value is representing the probability of random findings, we always want to minimize this value. If the p-value was .5 (50%), that would mean that 50% of the time the results we see are just by chance. The p-value reflects how confident we are in our results and requires strict interpretation. A commonly used cut-off is 0.05 (5% chance the results observed are by chance) or below. \n",
    "* If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, we can deem our results to be statistically significant. \n",
    "* If the p-value is greater than 0.05, our results are not statistically significant. \n",

    "***\n",
    "Regression analyses are rarely a \"one and done\" situation. After you run your analyses, you should tweak your model (equation) and see if you can improve the model fit. A good place to start is by removing non-significant variables from our model. In this example, gender and age are not significant - let's try a model without them!"
